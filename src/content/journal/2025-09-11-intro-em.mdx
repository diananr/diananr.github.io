I listened to the first episode of season seven of the [Ladybug Podcast](https://www.ladybug.dev/), titled _A Brief Introduction to Engineering Management_. Here are my notes:

### Notes

Some quotes and insights from the hosts:

- "Engineering management is the tactical actions you take to show that you are a leader of people. You focus on the delivery of projects."
- "Leadership is how you show up: how you communicate with your team, handle conflicts, and foster growth for both yourself and your team."
- "Anybody can be a leader without having direct reports."
- "Tech leads are responsible for project delivery and architectural design, ensuring high-quality outcomes."
- "Team leads start to take on people management while still contributing technically. It's a hybrid of individual contribution and management."
- The goal: _“My team is very self-managed.”_
- Many managers struggle with staying technical while managing teams.
- "There's a difference between being friends with your team and being friendly with them."
- Influence is key: the ability to have meaningful conversations across the organization determines success as a manager.
- Being open and receptive to feedback is essential—you won't make everyone happy all the time.

I'm really happy about this new season and grateful for the opportunity to learn from the hosts ✨
